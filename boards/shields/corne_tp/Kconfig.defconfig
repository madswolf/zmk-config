# Central Side Configuration
#
# The side on which the PS/2 mouse is connected MUST be the central side.
#
# By default zmk configures the LEFT side as the central side. But most people
# want to connect their pointing devices to the RIGHT side.
#
# So, you need to define that the central side is the one to which the
# pointing device is connected to.
