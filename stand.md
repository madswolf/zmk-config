# Tilting stand

The stand is mainly just to enable the keyboard to be tented up at an angle to enable more comfortable typing, but it was specifically designed to provide a typing experience closer to a traditional flat keyboard. Many ergonomic solutions for tenting are unstable, wobbly and can tend to slide on a desk or mat.  

Each half of the stand weighs 467grams with the tire weights and magsafe magnets, this gives it a nice heft and also increases the friction for the rubber feet, making it more stable and harder to move.

The stand uses magnets to hold the keyboard in place along with a custom bottom plate for the keyboard itself with a slanted edge to ensure good contact with the underlying surface which helps with stability and avoiding wobbling.

The two halves are split by a curve giving the visual impression a bit more flare, but it also serves as a locating feature for lining the two halves up with each other when combined. There are also magnets in the base to hold the two halves in place once combined.

The two halves are made of two pieces, a base which includes the tire weights, and a tilting element which is tilted 105 degrees and has a mounting hole for the magsafe magnet.

These two pieces are held together with three screws which screw into the base and into the corresponding embedded hex nuts in the tilting element.

These hex nuts are captive and uses a unique feature of 3D printing which is that the print is printed layer by layer so you can insert things while its printing and at the end it'll stay in place.

This is actually also used for the tire weights, and these two features was my first attempt at using this technique and it worked to great effect!

Overall i am pretty pleased with the end product, it feels very solid. But there are things i want to add. Namely the custom bottom plate features holes for screws so that a custom decorative top plate can be mounted with a different character and color scheme.

I also attempted to make a case that goes around the keyboard, but that sounded very hollow and was much louder than it was before.
This should be something that can be overcome, but i tried a few different things like filling the case with rice or wool and other materials without much luck.
